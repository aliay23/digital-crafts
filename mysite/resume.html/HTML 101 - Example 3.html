<h1><b> This example is about making lists</b></h1>

<body>
    <div><p> Here's what I like about lists:</p>
<ul>
<li> They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
<li> That's about it
<li> I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
</li></ul>


<p>When you make a list, do it in this order: </p>
<ol> 
   <li> Decide if it's an ordered list or not
   <li> If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
   <li> Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
   <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
   <li> You've got this, I believe in you!
    </li>
</ol>
